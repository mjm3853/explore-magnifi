Excellent. Here is a table comparing and contrasting MCP Tool Design with Standard API Design, using specific examples from the financial services domain to illustrate the key differences.

### **MCP Tool Design vs. Standard API Design: A Comparison for Financial Services**

| Characteristic | MCP Tool Design (AI-First) | Standard API Design (System-First) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Intent-Driven:** Models what a user *wants to achieve*. Abstracts away the system's complexity for the AI. | **Resource-Driven (RESTful):** Models the system's data and resources. Exposes granular Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations. |
| *Financial Example* | A single `execute_trade` tool that understands an instruction like "Buy 10 shares of TSLA for my Roth IRA." | Separate endpoints that a developer must call in sequence: `GET /users/{id}/accounts`, `GET /securities?symbol=TSLA`, `POST /accounts/{id}/orders`. |
| **Granularity & Scope** | **High-Level & Consolidated:** A single tool completes a full user workflow, often orchestrating multiple internal APIs. | **Low-Level & Atomic:** Each endpoint performs one specific, discrete action on a single resource. |
| *Financial Example* | A tool `onboard_new_client` that internally creates a user profile, triggers a KYC identity check, and opens a new checking account in one step. | Three distinct API calls required: `POST /users`, `POST /kyc_verifications`, and `POST /accounts`. The client application must manage the workflow. |
| **Naming & Documentation** | **Descriptive & Instructive:** Names and descriptions are functional prompts for the LLM, explaining purpose, use cases, and how to use it. | **Technical & Precise:** Names and documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) are for human developers, detailing the endpoint's function and data schema. |
| *Financial Example* | **Name:** `get_portfolio_insights`<br>**Description:** "Analyzes a user's investment portfolio to answer questions about performance, allocation, or risk." | **Endpoint:** `GET /users/{uid}/portfolio/{pid}/analytics`<br>**Documentation:** "Returns performance analytics object for a given portfolio ID." |
| **Error Handling** | **Actionable & Educational:** Errors tell the AI *why* it failed and *how to fix it*, often providing a corrected example or suggesting alternatives. | **Status Codes & Payloads:** Errors return a status code (e.g., 400, 403) and a JSON payload detailing the specific validation failure for a developer to debug. |
| *Financial Example* | "Error: The account 'IRA' has insufficient funds to purchase 10 shares. You have $250 available. You could purchase 1 share or add more funds." | `400 Bad Request` with body: `{ "error_code": "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", "message": "Balance is below the required amount for this transaction." }` |
| **Data Payloads (Output)** | **Context-Aware & Concise:** Returns only the information needed for the user's query or the next step, often summarized for direct use in conversation. | **Structured & Exhaustive:** Returns a complete, predictable JSON object representing the full state of the resource. |
| *Financial Example* | For the query "What's my checking balance?", the tool returns a simple string: "Your checking account #...1234 has a balance of $1,572.50." | `GET /accounts/{id}` returns the entire account object: `{ "id": "acct_123", "type": "checking", "balance": 1572.50, "currency": "USD", "opened_date": "..." }` |
| **State Management** | **Stateless by Design:** Aims to complete a workflow in one shot by taking all necessary information at once. The LLM holds the conversational state. | **Client-Side State:** The client application is responsible for managing state between multiple API calls (e.g., getting a list of payees before making a transfer). |
| *Financial Example* | The `transfer_funds` tool takes all parameters (from_account, to_beneficiary_name, amount) in a single call. | The client must first `GET /beneficiaries`, let the user select one, then use that beneficiary's ID in a subsequent `POST /transfers` call. |
