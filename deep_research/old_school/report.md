## 1. Advanced NLP for Controlled Financial Queries and Deterministic Dialogue Control

The development of a financial services chatbot, particularly one constrained by non-generative and compliance requirements, hinges on sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) and dialogue management techniques. These components must accurately interpret user queries related to personal portfolio data and market information, and navigate conversations along predictable, auditable trajectories.

This section explores the critical elements of intent recognition, slot filling, and deterministic dialogue management tailored for the financial domain and novice investors.

### 1.1. Robust Intent Recognition & Slot Filling for Financial Utterances

The primary challenge in the NLU module is the accurate parsing of queries from novice investors. Such queries may be ambiguously phrased, use colloquial language instead of precise financial terminology, or be incomplete. The system must reliably map these natural language inputs to a predefined set of intents (e.g., `get_portfolio_performance`, `get_transaction_history`, `lookup_market_price`) and extract relevant parameters, known as entities or slots (e.g., `account_type: "ISA"`, `asset_symbol: "AAPL"`, `time_period: "last_month"`).

#### Suitable Techniques for Non-Generative NLU

- **Transformer-based Models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for Classification:**
  - Used strictly for intent classification and slot tagging, not for generating language.
  - Pre-trained and fine-tuned on domain-specific financial datasets.
  - JointBERT (BERT + CRF) for simultaneous intent detection and slot filling.
  - Supervised pre-training (e.g., prefix-tuning, last-layer fine-tuning) enhances intent representations.

- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs):**
  - Used as a final layer in neural network architectures (LSTMs/Transformers) for sequence labeling tasks like slot filling.
  - Improve structured prediction by considering the context of neighboring labels.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs/BiLSTMs):**
  - Effective for capturing sequential information in text.
  - Often combined with CRFs for slot filling.

- **Open-Source NLU Libraries:**
  - **Rasa NLU:** Flexible, supports spaCy/BERT backends, on-premise deployment, custom entities/intents.
  - **spaCy:** Robust for tokenization, PoS tagging, NER; useful for custom NER models for financial terms.
  - **Other tools:** intent-classifier, DeepPavlov, Botpress (combines rule-based and ML NLU).

#### Slot Filling Mechanisms

- **Sequence Labeling:**
  - IOB tagging scheme (e.g., BiLSTM-CRF, Transformer-CRF)
- **Graph-based Slot Filling:**
  - Integrating knowledge graph triples for richer context
- **Dialogue State Tracking (DST):**
  - Fills slots based on entire dialogue history
- **Handling Financial Entities:**
  - Custom NER for financial terms (tickers, account types, metrics)

#### Key Technical Challenge: Ambiguity in Financial Language

- **Domain-Specific Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):**
  - Trained on financial texts with sense-tagged ambiguous terms
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
  - Provides contextual cues for disambiguation
- **Entity Linking:**
  - Connects mentions to canonical entries in a knowledge base

> **Note:** The non-generative interface places a heightened burden on the NLU module. Errors in intent recognition or slot filling can lead directly to conversational failures or incorrect actions. High precision and deep domain adaptation are required.

### 1.2. Deterministic Dialogue Management Strategies

Effective dialogue management is crucial for guiding the conversation, maintaining context, and ensuring that the chatbot's interactions are predictable and compliant. Strategies must focus on systems that ensure auditable conversational paths and manageable state tracking, explicitly avoiding unconstrained generative models for dialogue progression.

#### Approaches

- **Rule-Based Systems:**
  - IF-THEN-ELSE logic, highly predictable and transparent
  - Rasa's RulePolicy for hardcoded behaviors
- **Finite-State Machines (FSMs):**
  - Dialogues as a finite set of states with predefined transitions
  - Well-suited for straightforward, linear queries
- **Structured Graph-Based Dialogue Flows:**
  - More flexibility for complex, branching conversations
  - GraphTOD: JSON-defined transition graphs for task-oriented dialogue
  - Rasa Forms: Structured mechanism for collecting required slots

#### State Tracking & Context Handling

- Store and update slot values as dialogue progresses
- Use dialogue history for context
- Modular design for maintainability

#### Robustness

- Design core financial tasks with rule-based or graph-based flows
- Augment with rule-based clarification sub-dialogues for ambiguity

### 1.3. Precision Query Formulation

Once the NLU module has recognized the user's intent and extracted the relevant entities (slots), this structured information must be translated into precise, executable queries against backend systems.

#### Approaches

- **Text-to-SQL (Constrained):**
  - Use template-based SQL generation, not generative models
  - Map intent-slot combinations to predefined SQL templates
  - Validate slot values to prevent SQL injection
- **SPARQL for Knowledge Graphs:**
  - Use templates for SPARQL queries
- **API Query Parameters:**
  - Transform intents/slots into API endpoint parameters

#### Compliance

- Ensure queries are syntactically and semantically valid
- Enforce access control and entitlements
- Validate input slot values and user permissions
