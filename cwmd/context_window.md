Excellent question. This is the "final boss" of building a data-intensive LLM application. The "hundreds of accounts, thousands of positions" scenario is precisely where naive approaches fail and a sophisticated, multi-layered architecture becomes essential.

You absolutely cannot and should not try to fit this into the context window. Your goal is to design a system where the LLM acts as a smart orchestrator, asking for tiny, relevant pieces of data from a powerful backend.

Here is the strategic playbook for this exact problem.

### The Golden Rule: The LLM is the CEO, Your Data Systems are the VPs

The CEO doesn't ask for a spreadsheet with every single company transaction to make a decision. They ask the VP of Finance for the "Q3 performance summary" or the VP of Sales for the "regional sales breakdown."

*   **LLM (The CEO):** The reasoning and natural language interface. It makes requests for information and synthesizes answers.
*   **Your Backend/Database (The VPs):** The source of truth. It performs the heavy lifting: filtering, aggregating, and calculating on massive datasets. It serves up only the final, summarized numbers.

The strategies below are all about building the communication channels between the CEO and the VPs.

### Strategy 1: Multi-Level RAG & Hierarchical Search (The Core Pattern)

This is the most critical concept. You treat the user's data like a hierarchical file system, and you only "open" the folders and files you need.

**Level 1: The "Portfolio Index" (Always in Context)**

This is a high-level summary that *always* gets loaded into the conversation's base context. It's a "map" of the user's entire financial world. It must be small and token-efficient.

**What it contains:**

*   A list of all accounts by `account_id`, `account_name` ("My Roth IRA"), `account_type` ("Retirement"), and `total_value`.
*   A brief, pre-calculated summary of the entire portfolio (total value, 24h change, etc.).
*   Crucially, **no position-level detail.**

**Example "Portfolio Index" JSON (for the system prompt):**

```json
{
  "portfolio_summary": {
    "total_value": 7854321.50,
    "day_change_usd": -15200.75
  },
  "accounts_index": [
    {"id": "acc_ira_1", "name": "Fidelity Roth IRA", "type": "Retirement", "value": 543210.00},
    {"id": "acc_401k_2", "name": "Vanguard 401k", "type": "Retirement", "value": 1250000.00},
    {"id": "acc_brk_3", "name": "Schwab Brokerage", "type": "Taxable", "value": 6061111.50}
    // ... 97 more account summaries
  ]
}
```

**How it's used:** If the user asks, "How's my Roth IRA doing?", the LLM can see `acc_ira_1` in the index and knows which account to investigate further using its tools.

**Level 2: The "Account/Position Summary" (On-Demand Tool Call)**

When the LLM needs to know what's inside an account, it uses a tool.

*   **Tool:** `get_account_details(account_id: str)`
*   **Action:** Your backend queries the database for the specified `account_id`.
*   **Return Value:** It does **not** return all 500 positions. It returns another summary:
    *   Top 5 holdings by value.
    *   Asset class breakdown (e.g., 60% equities, 30% bonds, 10% cash).
    *   A list of all tickers held in that account (just the symbols, not the full data).

**Level 3: The "Granular Data" (The Final Drill-Down)**

This is for when the user asks a highly specific question.

*   **Tool:** `get_position_details(account_id: str, tickers: List[str], start_date: str, end_date: str)`
*   **Action:** Your backend now fetches the specific rows from your transaction/position database for *only* the requested tickers in the specified account and date range.
*   **Return Value:** A compact, token-efficient serialization (like CSV) of the exact data needed.

This hierarchical approach ensures you never load more than a few kilobytes of text into the context window, even if the user's data is gigabytes in size.

### Strategy 2: Semantic Search on Metadata (For "Fuzzy" Questions)

What if the user asks, "How are my 'risky tech bets' performing?" The term 'risky tech bets' doesn't exist in your structured database.

**This is where you use a Vector Database.**

1.  **Offline Process (Indexing):** For each position and account, you create a "metadata document" and embed it using a sentence-transformer model.
    *   **Document for a position:** `Ticker: NVDA, Name: NVIDIA Corp. Industry: Semiconductors. My Notes: A long-term bet on AI growth.`
    *   **Document for an account:** `Account Name: "Play Money - High Risk", Account ID: acc_brk_5. User Description: For experimenting with volatile stocks.`
2.  **Online Process (Querying):**
    *   The user asks: "How are my risky tech bets?"
    *   Your system recognizes this is a "fuzzy" search, not a direct lookup.
    *   It calls a tool: `find_relevant_assets(search_query: "risky tech bets")`.
    *   This tool embeds the user's query and performs a similarity search against your vector database.
    *   **The search returns a list of `account_ids` and `tickers`** (e.g., `['acc_brk_5', 'NVDA', 'TSLA']`).
3.  **Fuse with Strategy 1:** The list of IDs from the semantic search is now fed into the structured tools from the hierarchical approach (e.g., `get_position_details(tickers=['NVDA', 'TSLA'])`).

This powerfully combines structured filtering with unstructured, semantic understanding.

### Strategy 3: Intelligent Query Decomposition (LLM as a Planner)

For multi-part questions, the LLM must act as a planner.

**User Query:** "Compare the performance of my renewable energy stocks in my IRA with my semiconductor stocks in my brokerage account over the last year."

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial LLM Call (Planning):** You send the query to the LLM and ask it to produce a plan of tool calls.
2.  **LLM Response (The Plan):** The LLM, using the tools you've defined, outputs a sequence of steps:
    ```json
    [
      { "tool": "find_relevant_assets", "parameters": {"account_id": "acc_ira_1", "search_query": "renewable energy stocks"} },
      { "tool": "find_relevant_assets", "parameters": {"account_id": "acc_brk_3", "search_query": "semiconductor stocks"} }
    ]
    ```
3.  **Your Backend (Orchestration):** Your code executes these tool calls in parallel.
    *   Call 1 returns `tickers: ['ENPH', 'FSLR']`.
    *   Call 2 returns `tickers: ['NVDA', 'AMD']`.
4.  **Second Round of Tool Calls:** Your orchestrator now has the tickers and calls the performance tool:
    *   `get_position_details(account_id='acc_ira_1', tickers=['ENPH', 'FSLR'], ...)`
    *   `get_position_details(account_id='acc_brk_3', tickers=['NVDA', 'AMD'], ...)`
5.  **Final LLM Call (Synthesis):** Your backend collects the results from all calls, formats them into a single, compact context (e.g., two small CSV tables), and sends them to the LLM with the original query: "Here is the performance data for renewable and semiconductor stocks. Please compare them and answer the user's question."

### Summary Table of Strategies

| Strategy | Problem Solved | Key Technique | Example Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Level RAG** | Massive scale of structured data (thousands of positions). | Hierarchical data fetching; progressive disclosure. | `get_account_details(id)`, `get_position_details(id, tickers)`|
| **Semantic Search**| Vague, "fuzzy," or concept-based user questions. | Vector embeddings on metadata and user-provided notes. | `find_relevant_assets(query)` |
| **Query Decomposition**| Complex, multi-part questions requiring several data points. | LLM acts as a planner, your backend acts as an orchestrator. | `compare_performance(group_a, group_b)` |

By combining these strategies, you build a system that is scalable, intelligent, and efficient, ensuring you never hit context window limits while providing powerful, accurate answers to your users.
