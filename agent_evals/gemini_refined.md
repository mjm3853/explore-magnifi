# Prompt to Gemini:

awesome stuff, what if the initial dataset is made simpler but still valuable. how about following the information at https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-agent-evaluation-in-vertex-ai-gen-ai-evaluation-service and other sources where we start with evaluating the trajectory and output

# Gemini Response:

You're absolutely right to consider starting with a simpler, more focused dataset, especially when tools like Vertex AI's Gen AI Evaluation Service provide frameworks for assessing agent trajectory and output. This is a smart, pragmatic approach.

Let's break down how to create a valuable initial dataset focusing on trajectory and output, keeping those principles in mind:

**I. Core Idea: Trajectory and Output Evaluation**

*   **Trajectory Evaluation:** This looks at the *steps* the agent takes to arrive at an answer. Did it call the right tools/APIs? Did it use the correct parameters? Did it query the knowledge base effectively?
*   **Output Evaluation:** This assesses the final response given to the user. Is it accurate, helpful, safe, and grounded in the information gathered during its trajectory?

**II. Simplified Dataset Structure (Focused on Trajectory & Output)**

You can streamline the extensive list provided earlier. For each interaction/turn:

*   **`interaction_id`**: Unique ID for the conversation.
*   **`turn_id`**: Unique ID for this specific turn.
*   **`user_utterance`**: The raw text input from the user.
*   **`conversation_history`**: (Optional but highly recommended for multi-turn) Previous user/agent turns.
*   **`user_id_or_profile_type`**: (Optional) Links to a simplified user profile or a type (e.g., `novice_investor`, `experienced_trader_with_portfolio`) to give context.
    *   *Simplified Portfolio Context*: Instead of a full portfolio, you might just provide key facts relevant to the test case, e.g., "User holds 100 shares of GOOG," or "User's risk tolerance is moderate."

*   **Annotation for Trajectory Evaluation:**
    *   **`expected_tool_calls`**: (Crucial) A list of the tools the agent *should* have invoked.
        *   Format: `[{"tool_name": "get_stock_price", "parameters": {"ticker": "MSFT"}}, {"tool_name": "search_knowledge_base", "parameters": {"query": "what is dollar cost averaging"}}]`
        *   This is where services like Vertex AI Agent Evaluation shine, as they can compare the agent's actual tool calls to these expected ones.
    *   **`expected_knowledge_source_interaction`**: (If applicable)
        *   If the agent should query a KB, what's the ideal query or the key concepts it should look for? E.g., `expected_kb_query_keywords: ["inflation", "impact", "portfolio"]`.
        *   `expected_kb_article_ids_retrieved`: (Optional, more advanced) If you know specific articles should be hit.

*   **Annotation for Output Evaluation:**
    *   **`ideal_agent_response_key_points` OR `required_information_elements`**: Instead of a full gold-standard response, list the essential pieces of information the agent must convey.
        *   Example: For "What's the P/E of AAPL and its current price?", key points might be: `["AAPL P/E ratio is X", "AAPL current price is Y"]`. This is easier to annotate than a full paragraph.
    *   **`acceptable_response_attributes`**: (Checklist-style)
        *   `factual_accuracy_level`: (e.g., High, Medium, Low - or specific facts to check)
        *   `completeness_of_key_points`: (Yes/No, or % of key points covered)
        *   `safety_guidelines_met`: (Yes/No - e.g., includes necessary disclaimers for financial advice).
        *   `grounding_reference_expected`: (Yes/No - should the agent cite a source from its tool calls/KB lookup?)
    *   **`task_completion`**: (Simple) Did the agent successfully address the user's immediate request? (e.g., `fully_completed`, `partially_completed`, `failed`).

**III. How This Simpler Dataset Powers Evaluation (e.g., with Vertex AI):**

1.  **Tool Use Validation:**
    *   The platform can directly compare the agent's `actual_tool_calls` (which it logs) with your annotated `expected_tool_calls`.
    *   Metrics: Tool call precision/recall, parameter matching accuracy.

2.  **Information Grounding & Faithfulness:**
    *   By comparing the agent's output against the data retrieved from its (correctly) called tools or KB, you can assess if the response is faithful to its sources.
    *   Your `ideal_agent_response_key_points` help define what "faithful" means.

3.  **Response Quality (Simplified but Effective):**
    *   **Factual Accuracy:** Evaluators (human or model-based, if carefully prompted) can check if the key points in the agent's response are true, based on the ground truth data snapshot (even if it's just a few key numbers for that test case).
    *   **Completeness:** Does the agent's response contain all `required_information_elements`?
    *   **Safety:** Does it meet the `safety_guidelines_met` criteria?
    *   Vertex AI evaluators often allow for these custom metrics based on your annotations.

4.  **Instruction Following (Implicit):**
    *   The overall prompt/instructions you give your agent (e.g., "You are a helpful financial assistant. Always provide disclaimers for investment advice.") can be partially evaluated by checking if the `safety_guidelines_met` are adhered to in the output.

**IV. Streamlined Annotation Process:**

*   **Focus on "What Should Happen":** Annotators concentrate on the ideal sequence of tool calls and the essential facts for the response.
*   **Leverage Templates for Tool Calls:** If your tools have fixed names and common parameter patterns, this can speed up `expected_tool_calls` annotation.
*   **Prioritize High-Impact Scenarios:** Start with common user queries and critical financial tasks.
*   **Use LLMs as "First Draft" Annotators (with Human Review):**
    *   You can prompt an LLM: "Given user query 'X' and available tools Y, Z, what tools should be called with what parameters?" -> Human review and correction.
    *   "Given query 'X' and facts F, G, H, what are the key points for a helpful response?" -> Human review and refinement.

**V. Value of This Simplified Approach:**

*   **Faster to Create:** Less annotation burden per data point means you can build an initial evaluation set more quickly.
*   **Directly Actionable Insights:** Quickly identifies if the agent is failing in its core reasoning (tool use) or in presenting correct information.
*   **Good Fit for Automated Evaluation Platforms:** The structure aligns well with how services like Vertex AI Agent Evaluation operate.
*   **Scalable Foundation:** You can always enrich this dataset later by adding more detailed annotations (like full `ideal_agent_response_detailed` or more nuanced user profiles) as your evaluation needs evolve.

**Example Test Case (Simplified):**

*   `interaction_id`: `conv_001`
*   `turn_id`: `turn_001`
*   `user_utterance`: "What's the current price of Google and its P/E ratio?"
*   `user_id_or_profile_type`: `generic_market_query`
*   `expected_tool_calls`: `[{"tool_name": "get_stock_data", "parameters": {"ticker": "GOOG"}}]` (Assuming this tool returns both price and P/E)
*   `ideal_agent_response_key_points`: `["GOOG current price is $X", "GOOG P/E ratio is Y"]`
*   `acceptable_response_attributes`: `{"factual_accuracy_level": "High", "completeness_of_key_points": "Yes", "safety_guidelines_met": "N/A"}`
*   `task_completion`: `fully_completed`

This simplified structure provides a strong starting point for meaningful agent evaluation, especially when combined with platforms designed to assess agent trajectories and outputs. It allows you to iterate faster and get crucial feedback on your agent's core functionalities.
